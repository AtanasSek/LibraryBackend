### Instructions

**Build and run the backend app using `gradlew bootRun` in the main folder.**

There is an accompanying frontend react build in this next link:
https://github.com/AtanasSek/LibraryFrontend

Simply clone, or download the frontend app. **Install necessary modules using `npm install`, and finally, 
launch the app with `npm start src/index.js`** 

The backend app will launch on port 8080, the frontend one will launch on 3000.
